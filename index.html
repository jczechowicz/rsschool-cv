			<h3> Summary: </h3>
			<p>Hello, World! I am a philosophy student living in Warsaw. I am fascinated by issues at the interface of the humanities and technology, in particular related to social and ethical risks, etc. Apart from that, I am persistently learning programming: mainly Python/Java, but since some time I am also learning web languages. That's why I am very enthusiastic towards The Rolling Scopes because I feel a lot useful knowledge here.</p>
